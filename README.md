# JavaScript Vulnerabilities Analysis

This repository contains a dataset downloaded from Kaggle and an analysis of JavaScript vulnerabilities using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Filename:** `JSvulnerabilities_model.ipynb`
- **Description:** The dataset includes various JavaScript vulnerabilities with features useful for classification and clustering.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze JavaScript vulnerabilities and apply machine learning techniques such as clustering (K-Means) to identify patterns in the data. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook JSVulnerabilities_model.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, visualize insights, and apply machine learning models.
- Modify parameters and models as needed to experiment with different approaches.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

(Install missing dependencies using `pip install package_name`.)

## Results

The notebook includes visualizations and clustering results that help in understanding JavaScript vulnerabilities better. The findings can be used for further security research and improvements.
